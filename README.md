# Challenge 11
## Overview of the project
For this analysis we will be creating filters for a data colection of UFO sightings, separating them by state, country, date, shape and city.

## Results 
Some of the searches that would be possible with this new engine are a search of all the sightings by state (for exaple a list of all the sightings in Alaska)
![alaska search](/images/state_search.PNG)

Or a detailes search with specific details (such as state, shape and date)
![compound search](/images/compound_search.PNG)

## Summary
This is a great way to filter through this data set, although its a static dataset, one further improvement to be made could be to connect the web page to a database or to webscrape more data daily.

Another thing to improve the code would be to invest some more time into formating and design so that it fits more browsers.
